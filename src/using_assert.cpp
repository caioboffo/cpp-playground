// void assert (int expression);
// Evaluate assertion
// If the argument expression of this macro with functional form compares equal to zero (i.e., the expression is false), a message is written to the standard error device and abort is called, terminating the program execution.

// The specifics of the message shown depend on the particular library implementation, but it shall at least include: the expression whose assertion failed, the name of the source file, and the line number where it happened. A usual expression format is:

// Assertion failed: expression, file filename, line line number 

// This macro is disabled if, at the moment of including <assert.h>, a macro with the name NDEBUG has already been defined. This allows for a coder to include as many assert calls as needed in a source code while debugging the program and then disable all of them for the production version by simply including a line like:
 
// #define NDEBUG 

// at the beginning of the code, before the inclusion of <assert.h>.

// Therefore, this macro is designed to capture programming errors, not user or run-time errors, since it is generally disabled after a program exits its debugging phase.#include <stdio.h>      /* printf */
